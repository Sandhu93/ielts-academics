                                    <p>Today, the quest continues. On Daphne Major-one of the most desolate of the
                                        Galápagos Islands, an uninhabited volcanic cone where cacti and shrubs seldom
                                        grow higher than a researcher’s knee-Peter and Rosemary Grant have spent more
                                        than three decades watching Darwin’s finch respond to the challenges of storms,
                                        drought and competition for food Biologists at Princeton University, the Grants
                                        know and recognize many of the individual birds on the island and can trace the
                                        birds’ lineages hack through time. They have witnessed Darwin’s principle in
                                        action again and again, over many generations of finches.</p>

                                    <p>The Grants’ most dramatic insights have come from watching the evolving bill of
                                        the medium ground finch. The plumage of this sparrow-sized bird ranges from dull
                                        brown to jet black. At first glance, it may not seem particularly striking, but
                                        among scientists who study evolutionary biology, the medium ground finch is a
                                        superstar. Its bill is a middling example in the array of shapes and sizes found
                                        among Galápagos finches: heftier than that of the small ground finch, which
                                        specializes in eating small, soft seeds, but petite compared to that of the
                                        large ground finch, an expert at cracking and devouring big, hard seeds.</p>
                                    <p><strong>C</strong></p>
                                    <p>When the Grants began their study in the 1970s, only two species of finch lived
                                        on Daphne Major, the medium ground finch and the cactus finch. The island is so
                                        small that the researchers were able to count and catalogue every bird. When a
                                        severe drought hit in 1977, the birds soon devoured the last of the small,
                                        easily eaten seeds. Smaller members of the medium ground finch population,

                                    <p>Bill and body size are inherited traits, and the next generation had a high
                                        proportion of big-billed individuals. The Grants had documented natural
                                        selection at work-the same process that, over many millennia, directed the
                                        evolution of the Galápagos’ 14 unique finch species, all descended from a common
                                        ancestor that reached the islands a few million years ago.</p>

                                    <p>Eight years later, heavy rains brought by an El Nino transformed the normally
                                        meager vegetation on Daphne Major. Vines and other plants that in most years
                                        struggle for survival suddenly flourished, choking out the plants that provide
                                        large seeds to the finches. Small seeds came to dominate the food supply, and
                                        big birds with big bills died out at a higher rate than smaller ones. ‘Natural
                                        selection is observable,’ Rosemary Grant says. ‘It happens when the environment
                                        changes. When local conditions reverse themselves, so does the direction of
                                        adaptation.</p>

                                    <p>Recently, the Grants witnessed another form of natural selection acting on the
                                        medium ground finch: competition from bigger, stronger cousins. In 1982, a third
                                        finch, the large ground finch, came to live on Daphne Major. The stout bills of
                                        these birds resemble the business end of a crescent wrench. Their arrival was
                                        the first such colonization recorded on the Galápagos in nearly a century of
                                        scientific observation. ‘We realized,’ Peter Grant says, ‘we had a very unusual
                                        and potentially important event to follow.’ For 20 years, the large ground finch
                                        coexisted with the medium ground finch, which shared the supply of large seeds
                                        with its bigger-billed relative. Then, in 2002 and 2003, another drought struck.
                                        None of the birds nested that year, and many died out. Medium ground finches
                                        with large bills, crowded out of feeding areas by the more powerful large ground
                                        finches, were hit particularly hard.</p>
                                    <p><strong>G</strong></p>
                                    <p>When wetter weather returned in 2004, and the finches nested again, the new
                                        generation of the medium ground finch was dominated by smaller birds with
                                        smaller bills, able to survive on smaller seeds. This situation, says Peter
                                        Grant, marked the first time that biologists have been able to follow the
                                        complete process of an evolutionary change due to competition between species
                                        and the strongest response to natural selection that he had seen in 33 years of
                                        tracking Galápagos finches.</p>

                                    <p>On the inhabited island of Santa Cruz, just south of Daphne Major, Andrew Hendry
                                        of McGill University and Jeffrey Podos of the University of Massachusetts at
                                        Amherst have discovered a new, man-made twist in finch evolution. Their study
                                        focused on birds living near the Academy Bay research station, on the fringe of
                                        the town of Puerto Ayora. The human population of the area has been growing
                                        fast-from 900 people in 1974 to 9,582 in 2001. Today Puerto Ayora is full of
                                        hotels and mai tai bars,’ Hendry says. ‘People have taken this extremely arid
                                        place and tried to turn it into a Caribbean resort.’</p>
                                    <p><strong>I</strong></p>
                                    <p>Academy Bay records dating back to the early 1960s show that medium ground
                                        finches captured there had either small or large bills. Very few of the birds
                                        had mid-size bills. The finches appeared to be in the early stages of a new
                                        adaptive radiation: If the trend continued, the medium ground finch on Santa
                                        Cruz could split into two distinct subspecies, specializing in different types
                                        of seeds. But in the late 1960s and early 70s, medium ground finches with
                                        medium-sized bills began to thrive at Academy Bay along with small and
                                        large-billed birds. The booming human population had introduced new food
                                        sources, including exotic plants and bird feeding stations stocked with rice.
                                        Billsize, once critical to the finches’ survival, no longer made any difference.
                                        ‘Now an intermediate bill can do fine,’ Hendry says.</p>
                                    <p><strong>J</strong></p>
                                    <p>At a control site distant from Puerto Ayora, and relatively untouched by humans,
                                        the medium ground finch population remains split between large- and small-billed
                                        birds. On undisturbed parts of Santa Cruz, there is no ecological niche for a
                                        middling medium ground finch, and the birds continue to diversify. In town,
                                        though there are still many finches, once-distinct populations are merging.</p>
                                    <p><strong>K</strong></p>
                                    <p>The finches of Santa Cruz demonstrate a subtle process in which human meddling
                                        can stop evolution in its tracks, ending the formation of new species. In a time
                                        when global biodiversity continues its downhill slide, Darwin’s finches have yet
                                        another unexpected lesson to teach. ‘If we hope to regain some of the diversity
                                        that’s already been lost/ Hendry says, ‘we need to protect not just existing
                                        creatures, but also the processes that drive the origin of new species.</p>

                                    <p>The potential for problems is certainly there. Modern airliners are packed with
                                        electronic devices that control the plane and handle navigation and
                                        communications. Each has to meet stringent safeguards to make sure it doesn’t
                                        emit radiation that would interfere with other devices in the plane-standards
                                        that passengers’ personal electronic devices don’t necessarily meet. Emissions
                                        from inside the plane could also interfere with sensitive antennae on the fixed

                                        agencies haven’t been able to find clear evidence of problems caused by personal
                                        electronic devices, including mobile phones. “We’ve done our own studies. We’ve
                                        found cellphones actually have no impact on the navigation system,” says
                                        Maryanne Greczyn, a spokeswoman for Airbus Industries of North America in
                                        Herndon, Virginia, Not do they affect other critical systems, she says The only
                                        impact Airbus found? “Sometimes when a passenger is starting or finishing a
                                        phone call, the pilot hears a wry slight beep in the headset,” she says.</p>

                                    <p>The best evidence yet of a problem comes from a report released this year by
                                        Britain’s Civil Aviation Authority. Its researchers generated simulated
                                        cellphone transmissions inside two Boeing aircraft. They concluded that the
                                        transmissions could create signals at a power and frequency that would not
                                        affect the latest equipment, but exceeded the safety threshold established in
                                        1984 and might, therefore, affect some of the older equipment on board. This
                                        doesn’t mean “mission critical” equipment such as the navigation system and
                                        flight controls. But the devices that could be affected, such as smoke detectors
                                        and fuel level indicators, could still create serious problems for the flight
                                        crew if they malfunction.</p>
                                    <p><strong>D</strong></p>
                                    <p>Many planes still use equipment certified to the older standards, says Dan
                                        Hawkes, head of avionics at the CAA’s Safely Regulation Croup. The CAA study
                                        doesn’t prove the equipment will actually fail when subjected to the signals but
                                        does show there’s a danger. “We’ve taken some of the uncertainty out of these
                                        beliefs,” he says Another study later this year will see if the cellphone
                                        signals actually cause devices to fail.</p>

                                    <p>In 1996, RTCA, a consultant hired by the Federal Aviation Administration in the
                                        US to conduct tests, determined that potential problems from personal electronic
                                        devices were “low”. Nevertheless, it recommended a ban on their use during
                                        “critical” periods of flight, such as take-off and landing. RTCA didn’t actually
                                        test cellphones, but nevertheless recommended their wholesale ban on flights,
                                        But if “better safe than sorry” is the current policy, it’s applied
                                        inconsistently, according to Marshall Cross, the chairman of Mega Wave
                                        Corporation, based in Boylston, Massachusetts. Why are cellphones outlawed when
                                        no one considers a ban on laptops? “It’s like most things in life. The reason is
                                        a little bit technical, a little bit economic and a little bit political,” says
                                        Cross.</p>

                                    <p>The company wrote a report for the FAA in 1998 saying it is possible to build an
                                        on-board system that can detect dangerous signals from electronic devices. But
                                        Cross’s personal conclusion is that mobile phones aren’t the real threat. “You’d
                                        have to stretch things pretty far to figure out how a cellphone could interfere
                                        with a plane’s systems,” he says. Cellphones transmit in ranges of around 400,
                                        800 or 1800 megahertz. Since no important piece of aircraft equipment operates
                                        at those frequencies, the possibility of interference is very low, Cross says.
                                        The use of Computers and electronic game systems is much more worrying, lie
                                        says. They can generate very strong signals at frequencies that could interfere
                                        with plane electronics, especially if a mouse is attached {the wire operates as
                                        an antenna or if their built-in shielding is somehow damaged. Some airlines are
                                        even planning to put sockets for laptops in seatbacks.</p>

                                    <p>There’s fairly convincing anecdotal evidence that some personal electronic
                                        devices have interfered with systems. Aircrew on one flight found that the
                                        autopilot was being disconnected, and narrowed the problem down to a passenger’s
                                        portable computer. They could actually watch the autopilot disconnect when they
                                        switched the computer on. Boeing bought the computer, took it to the airline’s
                                        labs and even tested it on an empty flight. But as with every other reported
                                        instance of interference, technicians were unable to replicate the problem.</p>
                                    <p><strong>H</strong></p>
                                    <p>Some engineers, however, such as Bruce Donham of Boeing, say that common sense
                                        suggests phones are more risky than laptops. “A device capable of producing a
                                        strong emission is not as safe as a device which does not have any intentional
                                        emission,” lie says. Nevertheless, many experts think it’s illogical that
                                        cellphones are prohibited when computers aren’t. Besides, the problem is more
                                        complicated than simply looking at power and frequency. In the air, the plane
                                        operates in a soup of electronic emissions, created by its own electronics and
                                        by ground-based radiation. Electronic devices in the cabin-especially those
                                        emitting a strong signal-can behave unpredictably, reinforcing other signals,
                                        for instance, or creating unforeseen harmonics that disrupt systems.</p>

                                    <p>Despite the Congressional subcommittee hearings last month, no one seems to be
                                        working seriously on a technical solution that would allow passengers to use
                                        their phones. That’s mostly because no one -besides cellphone users
                                        themselves-stands to gain a lot if the phones are allowed in the air. Even the
                                        cellphone companies don’t want it. They are concerned that airborne signals
                                        could cause problems by flooding a number of the networks’ base stations at once
                                        with the same signal This effect, called bigfooting, happens because airborne
                                        cellphone signals tend to go to many base stations at once, unlike land calls
                                        which usually go to just one or two stations. In the US, even if FAA regulations
                                        didn’t prohibit cellphones in the air, Federal Communications Commission
                                        regulations would.</p>
                                    <p><strong>J</strong></p>
                                    <p>Possible solutions might be to enhance airliners’ electronic insulation or to fit
                                        detectors which warned flight staff when passenger devices were emitting
                                        dangerous signals. But Cross complains that neither the FAA, the airlines nor
                                        the manufacturers are showing much interest in developing these. So despite
                                        Congressional suspicions and the occasional irritated (or jailed) mobile user,
                                        the industry’s “better safe than sorry” policy on mobile phones seems likely to
                                        continue. In the absence of firm evidence that the international airline
                                        industry is engaged in a vast conspiracy to overcharge its customers, a delayed
                                        phone call seems a small price to pay for even the tiniest reduction in the
                                        chances of a Plane Crash. But you’ll still be allowed to use your personal
                                        computer during a flight. And while that remains the case, airlines can hardly
                                        claim that logic has prevailed.</p>

                                    <p><strong>{A}</strong> On October 13,2,000, a small team of paleontologists led by
                                        Paul Sereno of the University of Chicago clambered out of three battered Land
                                        Rovers, filled their water bottles, and scattered on foot across the
                                        toffee-colored sands of the Tenere desert in northern Niger. The Tenere , on the
                                        southern flank of the Sahara, easily ranks among the most desolate landscapes on
                                        Earth. The Tuareg , turbaned nomads who for centuries have ruled this barren
                                        realm, refer to it as a “desert within a desert”-a California-size ocean of sand
                                        and rock, where a single massive dune might stretch a hundred miles, and the
                                        combination of 120-degree heat and inexorable winds can wick the water from a
                                        human body in less than a day. The harsh conditions, combined with intermittent
                                        conflict between the Tuareg and the Niger government, have kept the region
                                        largely unexplored.</p>
                                    <p><strong>{B}</strong> Mike Hettwer, a photographer accompanying the team, headed
                                        off by himself toward a trio of small dunes. He crested the first slope and
                                        stared in amazement. The dunes were spilling over with bones. He took a few
                                        shots with his digital camera and hurried back to the Land Rovers. “I found some
                                        bones:’ Hettwer said, when the team had regrouped. “But they’re not dinosaurs.
                                        They’re human.”</p>
                                    <p><strong>{C}</strong> In the spring of 2005 Sereno contacted Elena Garcea, an
                                        archaeologist at the University of Cassino, in Italy, inviting her to accompany
                                        him on a return to the site. Garcea had spent three decades working digs along
                                        the Nile in Sudan and in the mountains of the Libyan Desert, and was well
                                        acquainted with the ancient peoples of the Sahara. But she had never heard of
                                        Paul Sereno. His claim to have found so many skeletons in one place seemed far
                                        fetched, given that no other Neolithic cemetery contained more than a dozen or
                                        so. Some archaeologists would later be skeptical; one sniped that he was just a
                                        “moonlighting paleontologist.” But Garcea was too intrigued to dismiss him as an
                                        interloper. She agreed to join him.</p>
                                    <p><strong>{D}</strong> Garcea explained that the Kiffian were a fishing-based
                                        culture and lived during the earliest wet period, between 8,000 and 10,000 years
                                        ago. She held a Kiffian sherd next to a Tenerian one. “What is so amazing is
                                        that the people who made these two pots lived more than a thousand years apart.”
                                    </p>
                                    <p><strong>{E}</strong> Over the next three weeks, Sereno and Garcea-along with five
                                        American excavators, five Tuareg guides, and five soldiers from Nigeria’s army,
                                        sent to protect the camp from bandits—made a detailed map of the site, which
                                        they dubbed Gobero, after the Tuareg name for the area. They exhumed eight
                                        burials and collected scores of artifacts from both cultures. In a dry lake bed
                                        adjacent to the dunes, they found dozens of fishhooks and harpoons carved from
                                        animal bone Apparently the Kiffian fishermen weren’t just going after small fry:
                                        Scattered near the dunes were the remains of Nile perch, a beast of a fish that
                                        can weigh nearly 300 pounds, as well as crocodile and hippo bones.</p>
                                    <p><strong>{F}</strong> Sereno flew home with the most important skeletons and
                                        artifacts and immediately began planning for the next field season. In the
                                        meantime, he carefully removed one tooth from each of four skulls and sent them
                                        to a lab for radiocarbon dating. The results pegged the age of the tightly
                                        bundled burials at roughly 9,000 years old, the heart of the Kiffian era. The
                                        smaller “sleeping” skeletons turned out to be about 6,000 years old, well within
                                        the Tenerian period. At least now the scientists knew who was who.</p>
                                    <p><strong>{G}</strong> In the fall of 2006 they returned to Gobero, accompanied by
                                        a larger dig crew and six additional scientists. Garcea hoped to excavate some
                                        80 burials, and the team began digging. As the skeletons began to emerge from
                                        the dunes, each presented a fresh riddle, especially the Tenerian. A male
                                        skeleton had been buried with a finger in his mouth.</p>
                                    <p><strong>{H}</strong> Even at the site, Arizona State University bio archaeologist
                                        Chris Stojanowski could begin to piece together some clues. Judging by the
                                        bones, the Kiffian appeared to be a peaceful, hard working people. “The lack of
                                        head and forearm injuries suggests they weren’t doing much fighting,” he told
                                        me. “And these guys were strong.” He pointed to a long, narrow ridge running
                                        along a femur. “That’s the muscle attachment,” he said. “This individual had
                                        huge leg muscles, which means he was eating a lot of protein and had a strenuous
                                        lifestyle — both consistent with a fishing way of life.” For contrast, he showed
                                        me the femur of a Tenerian male. The ridge was barely perceptible. “This guy had
                                        a much less strenuous lifestyle,” he said, “which you might expect of a herder.”
                                    </p>
                                    <p><strong>{I}</strong> Stojanowski’s assessment that the Tenerian were herders fits
                                        the prevailing view among scholars of life in the Sahara 6,000 years ago, when
                                        drier conditions favored herding over hunting. But if the Tenerian were herders,
                                        Sereno pointed out, where were the herds? Among the hundreds of animal bones
                                        that had turned up at the site, none belonged to goats or sheep, and only three
                                        came from a cow species. “It’s not unusual for a herding culture not to
                                        slaughter their cattle, particularly in a cemetery, M Garcea responded, noting
                                        that even modern pastoralists, such as Niger’s Wodaabe, are loath to butcher
                                        even one animal in their herd. Perhaps, Sereno reasoned, the Tenerian at Gobero
                                        were a transitional group that had not fully adopted herding and still relied
                                        heavily on hunting and fishing.</p>
                                    <p><strong>{J}</strong> Back in Arizona, Stojanowski continues to analyze the Gobero
                                        bones for clues to the Green Saharans’ health and diet. Other scientists are
                                        trying to derive DNA from the teeth, which could reveal the genetic origins of

                                        Sereno and Garcea estimate a hundred burials remain to be excavated. But as the
                                        harsh Tenere winds continue to erode the dunes, time is running out. “Every
                                        archaeological site has a life cycle,” Garcea said. “It begins when people begin
                                        to use the place, followed by disuse, then nature takes over, and finally it is
                                        gone. Gobero is at the end of its life.”</p>
